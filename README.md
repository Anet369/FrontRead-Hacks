# Unfinished Spaghetti (that works)

This hack is just unfinished spaghetti, that I lost interest in.

Non the less it works and I thought I would publish it here for anyone to play around with.

# DISCLAIMER:
I am in no way responsible for what you use this for. (So don't come running if you get into trouble).
This has also already been reported to FrontRead awhile ago, but since they haven't changed it yet, I don't think they will.

# How to use
There are 2 interesting things.
```js
function LoginAs(uniLogin)
```
Give it a uni login and it will log you in as that user<br />
**For noobs**: <br />
Press F12 > Go to console > Write "LoginAs(**UNILOGIN**)" where **UNILOGIN** is the uni login you want to login as > Press Enter

```
$("body").on("keydown"...
```
This section of the code lets you do 2 things
1. On the home screen (where you can see all the different modules) you can press **Enter** and the diplom will be unlocked (and your teacher will be mad AF)
2. On the screen where you can start a certain attempt on a certain exercise, you can press **Space** and you get a prompt there you can enter your wanted results
